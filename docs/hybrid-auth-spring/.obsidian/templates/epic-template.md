# EPIC-<% id %> — <% slug.replace(/-/g, " ") %>

<!--
Type semantics:
- capability — themed body of product work (e.g. "authentication", "billing").
- refactor  — quality / restructuring (e.g. "extract auth into its own crate").
- infra     — pipeline / observability / dev tools (e.g. "CI hardening").

(Temporal grouping — "bootstrap", "MVP", "v1" — is now a MILESTONE, not an epic type:
see `milestone-template.md`. A Milestone spans 1..N epics/SDDs, 1 : N.)

Epic *references* an SDD — it does not equal one (playbook §22.1; Epic : SDD ≈ 1 : 1).
A DOMAIN epic (`capability`) references exactly one bounded context — set `sdd:` to its
SDD ID (e.g. SDD-001); the SDD is the agnostic domain bible. A CROSS-CUTTING epic
(`refactor`, `infra`) references no bounded context — leave `sdd:` blank. The reference is
one-way: the epic points at the SDD; the SDD never points back.

## Why

<!-- One paragraph: what problem this epic addresses, what motivates it now. -->

## Outcome

<!-- The observable end-state. Not "we will refactor" — "the X module is split into Y and Z, with no callers depending on the old shape". -->

## Scope (in)

- <!-- bullet -->

## Out of scope

- <!-- explicitly deferred -->

## Exits with

<!--
Critério formal de "done" deste epic. Quando todos checados → status: done →
release candidate (see playbook-base.md §16.4). Each item should be testable
or observable.
