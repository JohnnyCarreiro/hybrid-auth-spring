# AGENTS.md — Hybrid Auth Spring (project root)

<!--
This is the project-root AGENTS.md template. Fill in the bracketed slots and trim
sections that don't apply to your tier (a prototype doesn't need bounded contexts;
a small project doesn't need outbox guidance). Cross-link to architecture/ docs as
they materialize.

`CLAUDE.md` should be a symlink to this file: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`. The
same trick works for any other agent that wants its own filename
(`ln -s AGENTS.md .cursorrules`, etc.).

## What this repo is

<!-- One sentence on what the project is and the broad shape (monorepo? single binary? service + ui?). -->
Hybrid Auth Spring — <one-line description>. <Stack summary, e.g. "Turborepo + Bun + Cargo workspace" or "single Rust binary" or "Next.js app">.

Canonical architecture docs live under `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/` — kept in sync with the code. If something there is wrong or outdated, flag in chat or open a PR; never let code and docs diverge silently.

## Methodology

This project follows the conventions in `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/playbook/`. The declarations below frame how the workflow operates here — fill them in and revisit when the project grows or shrinks.

**Two axes, one-way reference (management → docs).** DOCS live in `architecture/`: `SRS → SAD (+ADRs) → SDD → FRD` — **FRD is the last doc**; docs are management-agnostic (no `epic:`/`milestone:` fields). MANAGEMENT lives in roadmap/board/epics: `Milestone → Epic → Feature → Task`; it references docs by id (`sdd:`, `frd:`). An **SDD is a coherent DOMAIN** (`subdomain-type: core | supporting | generic`); an Epic *references* it via `sdd:`. The cardinality ruler (playbook §22.1):

| Pair | Cardinality | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Milestone : SDD | 1 : N | a milestone spans several domains/SDDs; cross-cutting/infra work sits in a milestone with **no** SDD |
| Epic : SDD | ≈ 1 : 1 | a domain epic references one SDD via `sdd:`; a cross-cutting epic references **none** |
| Feature : FRD | 1 : 1 | a Feature **is** the realization of one FRD |
| Task | = DAYS (1–2d) | smallest management unit; internal checklist = HOURS. XP/kanban-flow, not Scrum |

- **Tier**: <prototype | small | medium | large> — see playbook §21 (layered application).
- **Feature placement mode**: <A — sprint-bound | B — epic-bound | C — flat> — see playbook §23. The build is **feature-keyed** (one Feature = one FRD); the FRD spec stays in `architecture/frds/`. Mode A is the default for `small`+ with 3+ contributors; Mode B fits 1–2 contributors running kanban-flow; Mode C is for prototype-tier without epic/sprint apparatus.
- **Sprint planning**: <separate `planning.md` (Mode A, medium+) | section in sprint README (Mode A, small/prototype) | collapsed into the active epic's README (Modes B/C)>.
- **Documentation language**: English (default). Override only with a one-line justification, e.g.: `pt_BR — client mandate; code and code-comments stay in English`. See playbook §24. Code is always English — no override possible.
- **Active artefacts** (check what's currently in use; cross-reference promotion triggers in playbook §22):
  - [ ] `architecture/sdds/` — flat files `sdd-<slug>.md`, the bible of a coherent domain (an Epic references one via `sdd:`). See promotion trigger (3+ ADRs on a context, etc.)
  - [ ] `architecture/frds/` (medium+) — flat files `frd-<slug>.md`, per-functionality "what" (child of an SDD, 1:1 with a Feature). Absorbed into the SDD at prototype/small.
  - [ ] `roadmap/milestones/` — delivery groupings (Milestone : SDD = 1 : N) + `roadmap/archived/` for delivered work.
  - [ ] `architecture/data-model.md` — see promotion trigger (versioned migrations, etc.)
  - [ ] `architecture/threat-model.md` — required if untrusted input or sensitive data
  - [ ] `dev-pipeline/` — required when 3+ contributors edit shared docs

**RPA is a mental discipline, not files** — Research → Plan → Act produces exactly one artifact per node (the flat `sdd-<slug>.md`, the flat `frd-<slug>.md`, or the Feature's code + `README.md`). No `research.md`/`plan.md`/`act.md` by default; durable decisions go to an ADR. (Rare-audit exception: one `research.md` next to a node for audit/sensitive handoff — RARE; see playbook §23.)

When any promotion trigger fires, log the moment in `open-questions.md` (resolved section) or the active epic's progress log.

### Portability

This methodology is **portable by design** — workflow concepts map 1:1 to mainstream ticketing tools. If you're onboarding from another system, the quick translation is:

| Our concept | Jira | Linear | GitHub Projects |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backlog card | Issue (Backlog) | Issue (Backlog) | Issue + `backlog` label |
| Roadmap card | Issue (Committed) | Issue (Up Next) | Issue in Project |
| Milestone | Initiative | Project / Initiative | Milestone |
| Epic | Epic | Project | Milestone |
| Feature (1:1 FRD) | Story | Issue | Issue |
| Task (1–2 day unit) | Sub-task | Sub-issue | Task checklist item |
| Sprint | Sprint | Cycle | Iteration |
| `kind` field | Issue Type | Type | Label |
| `exits_with` | Epic checklist | Project completion | Milestone tasks |
| Architecture docs (SDD/FRD/ADR/SRS/SAD) / playbook / AGENTS.md | **stay in git** | **stay in git** | **stay in git** |

Full table, migration effort, and the hybrid (Jira+git) recommendation are in `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/playbook/playbook-base.md` §25. The TL;DR: workflow can migrate to a ticketing tool in 1–3 days if the project ever outgrows markdown; docs always stay in git.

## Agent-first architecture

This codebase is authored by AI agents collaborating with the human author. The agent's context window is the binding constraint, so:

- **Distinctive, greppable names** (target: <5 hits project-wide for unique identifiers).
- **Small, focused files** (≤ 500 lines, ideally 200–300).
- **Rich doc-comments on domain code** so agents don't have to chase definitions.
- **AGENTS.md at every module/context root** so agents read context before editing.

Read [[docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/playbook/playbook-base.md]] before writing code — it's the long-form version of these rules.

## Priority reading

In order, when starting a session here:

1. This `AGENTS.md` — declarations + project-specific overrides.
2. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/methodology.md` — operating guide (narrative): lifecycle, Day 1 onboarding, Day N feature loop, common recipes, FAQ.
3. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/playbook/playbook-base.md` — normative language-agnostic conventions.
4. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/playbook/playbook-java.md` — stack-specific rules and examples.
5. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/sad.md` (or `srs+sad.md` for prototype tier) — system architecture.
6. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/srs.md` (medium+) — requirements contract.
7. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/adrs/` — locked-in decisions; check before deviating.
8. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/sdds/sdd-<slug>.md` (when present) — flat-file tactical bible of a domain (an Epic references one via `sdd:`). `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/frds/frd-<slug>.md` (medium+) — the "what" of each functionality (1:1 with a Feature).
9. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/epics/` — active epic + its `sdd:` ref + `exits_with`.
10. `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/sprints/<active-sprint>/features/<feature-slug>/` (Mode A) **or** active epic's `features/<feature-slug>/` (Mode B) — current build work (Mode C: `features/<feature-slug>/`). The build is feature-keyed (no `frds/` folder): the feature `README.md` is the live trail and the code is the Act; the FRD spec stays in `architecture/frds/`.

If a decision in an ADR conflicts with what you intend to do, either follow the ADR or flag the discrepancy. Never silently deviate.

## Bounded contexts

<!-- Medium / large only. Delete this section for prototype / small. -->
<!-- List the contexts and their owning crate/package. Example: -->

| # | Context | Role | Owns |
|---|---------|------|------|
| 1 | <name> | <one-line role> | `<path/to/crate-or-package>` |

See `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/sad.md` for context boundaries; `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/sdds/sdd-<slug>.md` (flat file) for the tactical design of each domain (an Epic references it via `sdd:`), and `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/frds/frd-<slug>.md` for each functionality's "what" (1:1 with a Feature).

## Key directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| <!-- e.g. `apps/<app>` --> | <!-- responsibility --> |
| <!-- e.g. `crates/<context>` --> | <!-- responsibility --> |
| <!-- e.g. `packages/<pkg>` --> | <!-- responsibility --> |
| `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/` | Architecture, playbooks, sprint cards. |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: lint, typecheck, tests on every PR (see playbook §17.4). |

## Conventions

### Code style

<!-- Pin the formatter / linter and any non-default settings. Examples: -->
- **Lint + format**: <e.g. `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, or Biome `bun run lint`>.
- **Indentation**: <e.g. 4 spaces (Rust) / 2 spaces (TS, JSON, YAML, MD)>.

### Commits

Conventional Commits per playbook §16.1. Scopes for this repo:

<!-- List the scopes you actually use. Trim until accurate. Examples: -->
`<scope-1>`, `<scope-2>`, `(meta)`, `(docs)`, `(ci)`.

### Branching

Git Flow per playbook §16.2:
- `main` — production. Receives merges from release branches only (after bootstrap).
- `dev` — default working branch.
- Feature work on `feat/<slug>` branches off `dev`. Push, wait for human review, then PR (§16.3).

### Bootstrap-phase exception

Until the `EPIC-001 — bootstrap` epic closes (its `exits_with` all checked), direct commits to `dev` are allowed for scaffolding work. After bootstrap, every feature goes through the §16.3 loop. The `.bootstrap-complete` marker file (or repo tag) signals the transition.

### Errors

<!-- Pin the error pattern for this stack. Examples: -->
- **Rust**: `thiserror` + one enum per module. No `anyhow` in domain/application; only in `main.rs`.
- **TypeScript**: `Result<T, E>` pattern (or whatever the playbook-ts addendum specifies). No throwing for expected control flow.

### Tests

- Unit tests next to the code; integration tests in a top-level `tests/` directory (or `__tests__/`).
- One command per module: `<e.g. cargo test -p <crate>` / `bun test packages/<pkg>>`.

## Definition of Done

<!--
Trim this checklist to the tier of this project. The blocks below are cumulative —
small includes feature-level; medium includes feature-level + small; etc.
A card is **not** Done until every applicable box is checked.
-->

### Feature-level (every tier)

- [ ] Acceptance criteria / validation rules **from the FRD** (or the SDD's §8 "Functionalities" at prototype/small, where the FRD is absorbed) are all checked.
- [ ] Feature `README.md` closing retro written (at minimum: what shipped, what got punted, surprises). **The code is the Act**; there is no separate `act.md`.
- [ ] Code merged into `dev` via PR squash-merge, after the human-validation pause (playbook §16.3).
- [ ] CI green: format + lint + typecheck + tests (playbook §17.4).
- [ ] No `TODO`/`FIXME` left without a matching entry in `open-questions.md` or an issue.

### Additional for `small`+

- [ ] Module `AGENTS.md` updated if the public surface changed.
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and at least one negative case (per playbook §10.5).

### Additional for `medium`+

- [ ] ADR written if a non-trivial lock-in decision was made (playbook §18).
- [ ] SDD updated if invariants or operations of a bounded context changed; FRD updated if acceptance criteria or validation rules changed.
- [ ] Doc-comments on new public items carry provenance (invariants, emitted events, consumers, ADR link — see playbook §12).

### Additional for `large`

- [ ] Redlines under `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/dev-pipeline/redlines/` opened for non-trivial doc changes (SAD/SRS/SDD/FRD/data-model).
- [ ] Threat-model revisited if user-facing input shape changed.
- [ ] Migrations rehearsed against a production-like dataset.

### Epic-level (when this card closes an epic)

- [ ] All `exits_with` items in the epic file are checked.
- [ ] Epic moved to **Done** on the epics kanban.
- [ ] Release performed per playbook §16.4 (`dev → main`, tag, `CHANGELOG.md` entry).

## Local dev

```bash
# Initial setup (run once after clone)
<install-deps-command>          # e.g. bun install / cargo build
<env-setup-command>             # e.g. cp .env.example .env
<infra-up-command>              # e.g. docker compose up -d (if applicable)

# Day-to-day
<dev-command>                   # e.g. bun run dev / cargo run
<test-command>                  # e.g. bun test / cargo test --workspace
<lint-command>                  # e.g. bun run lint / cargo clippy
```

## Skills

<!-- List any custom Claude Code skills under `.claude/skills/`. Delete the
section if there are none. -->

- `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` — <one-line purpose>.

## Things to NOT do

<!-- Anti-patterns specific to this repo. Add as the project teaches you. Examples: -->

- **Don't commit secrets.** `.env` is git-ignored; keep `.env.example` in sync when new vars are added.
- **Don't bypass Conventional Commits.**
- **Don't reference other projects** by hardcoded paths. If cross-project context matters, document it explicitly.
- **Don't mix domain and infra concerns** in the same module.

## Per-module AGENTS.md

Each `<crate>/`, `<package>/`, or `<app>/` has its own `AGENTS.md` with surface-specific conventions, commands, and points of attention. **Read it when you enter the directory.** A template lives at `docs/hybrid-auth-spring/architecture/playbook/agents/module-AGENTS.template.md`.
